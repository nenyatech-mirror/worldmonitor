# Plugin parity acceptance matrix

Status: shared country view implemented; controlled local checks recorded below. Native acceptance and full parity remain open.

Compare the same country, tier and source snapshot. The website renderer is `CountryDeepDivePanel`. Derive section IDs from `BRIEF_SECTIONS`; ordinary countries render 23 of its 24 keys. China adds `china`. CII and resilience are separate summaries. Exclude unavailable measurements from factual comparisons while requiring their unavailable UI to match.

## Native Chrome check after the October 3 UTC reset

The check used the signed-in acceptance Chrome profile. The US website brief was refreshed at 00:00:04 UTC. The country request used **WorldMonitor MCP Acceptance**, connector `asdk_app_6abe6a56ddd08191b65e684c81dfed90`, in the acceptance chat. The tool succeeded with country US and topic all. Its iframe remained on “Connecting to WorldMonitor…”. Chrome requested `country-C1t3d1eZ.js`, which returned 404. The public current build and canonical MCP resource both referenced `country-Dqvrjg_F.js`, which returned 200. The exact deployment asset origin required authentication.

The browser used cached resource HTML from an earlier deployment. The cache-safe shell repair has controlled browser proof. Production acceptance remains blocked until this repair is merged, deployed and the acceptance connection discovers its v2 UI resources. Legacy resource reads remain aliases for existing descriptors; the obsolete raw cached HTML requires one connection refresh. New cached shells load the current panel document on each mount and show an interface retry on failure.

| Requested view | Refreshed website observation | Native ChatGPT observation | Difference and next proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| Country panel | 23 sections ready | Tool succeeded; iframe did not initialize | Repair asset delivery before comparing section values |
| CII | 43, Normal, falling, October 2 19:49 New York | No rendered value | Compare score and observation time after repair |
| Resilience | 59, interval 58–59, 87% coverage | No rendered value | Compare domains, confidence and entitlement |
| Five factors | Food 5, energy 4, demographics 4, technology 5, defense 5 | No rendered values | Compare underlying evidence |
| Signals | 3 critical news and 1 aviation; high, moderate and low counts 0 | Projection remains missing in plugin code | Separate implementation gap after delivery repair |
| Military | Own flights 0, foreign flights 0, naval 0; defense 3.4% in 2024; personnel 1,395,000 in 2020 | No rendered values | Compare same flight rights, dates and partial coverage |
| IMF | Growth 2.3%, inflation 3.2%, unemployment 4.4% | No rendered values | Compare same country and dataset observations |
| BIS | Residential 154.2 and commercial 187.3 in 2026 Q2; household DSR 8.0 in 2026 Q1 | No rendered values | Compare values, dates and missing-source notices |
| Atlas | No asset rows in this website snapshot | No rendered rows; PR #8799 remains unmerged | Recheck populated source coverage and original detail actions after merge |
| Usage | Website is a separate entitlement path | The opening tool succeeded; widget usage notice could not render | Controlled shell check uses one allocation; native accounting remains open |
| Installed cloud plugin | WorldMonitor version 2.10.1 visible as installed | Its headline starter redirected to Open ChatGPT Desktop | This is a separate installation path from the MCP Acceptance connection |

The website and acceptance connection's tiers have not been proved equal. These are captured observations, not a value-parity pass. News map markers, 2D and 3D interaction, host follow-up context and composer obstruction still need native production checks. Compact-panel parity remains open.

## Country data and sections

| ID | Surface | Existing data/render owner | Required proof | Current verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C01 | CII summary | Cached risk score, `CountryDeepDivePanel-cii` | Same score, components, band, trend, observation time; no zero on outage | Shared renderer and host risk read; outage fixture shows unavailable; live score comparison open |
| C02 | Resilience summary | `ResilienceWidget`, resilience service | Same domains, confidence, imputation/staleness and gate states | Shared widget and scoped source; denial fixture verified; live domain comparison open |
| C03 | Assessment | Country AI endpoint, `updateBrief` | Exact accepted assessment, citations and generation time; unsafe claims withheld | Shared assessment renderer; server quality risk remains open |
| C04 | Facts | `getCountryFacts`, `updateCountryFacts` | Same leadership, capital, population, area and source context | Shared renderer; US/UA facts, switching and lowercase input normalization verified with fixtures |
| C05 | Five factors | Scorecard service and renderer | All five factors and exact underlying measurements, keyboard tabs | Shared renderer; exact factor evidence fixture verified |
| C06 | Signals | Dashboard observations and signal projection | Same severity, counts, temporal scope and recent items | Explicit unavailable state; dashboard signal projection missing |
| C07 | Timeline | Country coverage/event projection, `CountryTimeline` | Same dated events and lanes, visible empty state | Shared timeline and host coverage; populated lane comparison open |
| C08 | News | Country coverage and news renderer | Same country relevance, deduplication, publisher roster and URLs | Shared news and host coverage; source-link fixture verified |
| C09 | Military | Military projection, defense-industrial service | Same activity scope and defense details; unavailable is not calm | Shared military projection and bounded flight/AIS/roster reads implemented; controlled desktop/mobile and failure checks; native comparison open. Redistributable flight coverage may differ from website display rights. The country read budget bounds flights to eight pages of 100; incomplete pagination shows unavailable counts. AIS uses one global relay snapshot, bounded to 1,500 candidate reports, then the shared country projection. Invalid report dates are excluded with a partial-coverage notice. |
| C10 | Sanctions | Pro section loader | Same entity count, active status and source scope | Shared renderer and server-authorized risk read; populated comparison open |
| C11 | Economics | IMF bundle and economic projection | Exact series, units, trends and native period labels | Native IMF read falsely returned locked; public single-key bootstrap repair verified locally; deployed comparison open |
| C12 | Housing | Housing-cycle loader | Exact availability, periods and values | Native BIS read falsely returned locked; public single-key bootstrap repair verified locally; deployed comparison open |
| C13 | Debt | National-debt loader | Debt ratio, debt amount, annual change and source | Shared loader/renderer; populated comparison open |
| C14 | Trade flows | Comtrade loader | Same partners, products, values and changes | Shared loader/renderer; populated comparison open |
| C15 | Tariffs | Tariff loader | Same current rate, historical series and direction | Shared loader/renderer; populated comparison open |
| C16 | Trade exposure | Chokepoint index and sector exposure | Same routes, sector weights and uncertainty | Shared projection/renderer; empty-state fixture verified |
| C17 | Scenario | Multi-sector cost shock | Same selected route/duration and calculated results | Shared calculator/source; no-exposure terminal state verified |
| C18 | Products | Country product imports | Exact products, suppliers, concentration and bypass details | Shared renderer/source; populated products/bypass comparison open |
| C19 | Prediction markets | Country markets | Same contracts, probability, provider and resolution links | Shared renderer and scoped markets source; populated comparison open |
| C20 | Energy | Country energy profile | Availability flags, mix, JODI, IEA and native dates preserved | Shared renderer/source; native observation comparison open |
| C21 | Maritime | Country port activity | Same port/cargo scope, trends, anomalies and dates | Shared renderer/source; populated port comparison open |
| C22 | Commodities | Country vulnerability loader | Same commodity dependencies and scenario inputs | Shared renderer/source; populated vulnerability comparison open |
| C23 | Food | Country and WORLD food stocks | Marketing years, stocks availability and global comparison preserved | Shared loader/renderer; stocks ratio and marketing-year fixture verified |
| C24 | Infrastructure | Related assets and disruption readers | Same assets and applicable current disruptions | Country Atlas counts and active shortage rows use fixed host readers. Original pipeline/storage/shortage drawers render details and sources; pipeline/storage timelines remain independent on outage. Country-bound asset identity, one allocation, agent actions, cancellation and desktop/mobile layout verified with compiled fixtures. Native comparison remains open. |
| C25 | Demographics | Demographics capability service/renderer | Same observations, imputation and unavailable values | Shared loader/renderer; populated/imputed comparison open |
| C26 | China conditional section | China decision signals | CN-only groups, provenance, translations, stale/unavailable states | Shared CN projection/renderer; website regression verified; native comparison open |

Shared rendering does not prove complete data or action parity. A populated observation comparison remains required wherever the verdict says open.

## Country actions and host behavior

| ID | Interaction | Acceptance check | Current verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A01 | Ordinary prompt | “USA country brief” opens the shared view in signed-in ChatGPT | View tool/skill/prompt implemented; native routing unverified |
| A02 | Follow-up | “Show energy exposure” changes topic and keeps the same country/revision in assistant context | Topic/context bridge implemented and fixture verified; native follow-up open |
| A03 | Country switch | US to JP with delayed US responses cannot repaint JP | Delayed US work cannot repaint UA in compiled iframe fixture |
| A04 | Topics/reading modes | Overview, full brief, topics and keyboard section navigation reuse website behavior | Shared topic/reading presentation; desktop/mobile fixture checks |
| A05 | Refresh/failure | One section failure preserves others and labels older successful data | Facts failure retains old observations and labels failure in fixture; lazy host refresh verified; assessment quota reused unless explicitly regenerated |
| A06 | Entitlement change | Server denies restricted reads; UI clears denied private data and shows a gate | Server denial and visible gate fixture verified; website revocation clears trade evidence and blocks cached reuse; live entitlement-change check open |
| A07 | Source links | Open valid source links through supported host actions without losing view | Host source-link fixture verified; native handoff open |
| A08 | Evidence export | Actual Markdown has matching evidence, sources and observation dates | Shared output mounted; actual evidence Markdown comparison open |
| A09 | Report/story | Actual downloaded output matches current country/sections and remains safe | Actual report HTML fixture inspected; story comparison open |
| A10 | Decision/commodity outputs | Inputs, calculations, evidence and actual outputs match website | Actual scenario JSON fixture inspected; commodity output comparison open |
| A11 | Account actions | Follow/notifications work inline under appropriate scope, or clearly disclose a website handoff | Explicit website handoff; inline mutation parity open |
| A12 | Responsive/native host | Desktop and mobile avoid overflow/composer obstruction; expand preserves conversation | Desktop/mobile fixture layout verified; native composer/expansion open |

## Other embedded surfaces

| UI tool | Website baseline to locate | Required next check | Current verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_country_risk` | Country CII/risk presentation | Compare all risk measures, times and outage states | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `get_world_brief` | World assessment presentation | Compare assessment, source coverage and relevant actions | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `get_market_data` | Market panels | Compare quote scope, timestamps, charts and filtering | PR #8813 restores loaded names, rows, charts and projection samples in controlled tests; deployed native parity unaccepted |
| `get_chokepoint_status` | Chokepoint/transit presentation | Compare routes, periods, risk and drill-down | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `get_news_intelligence` | News intelligence presentation | Compare sources, classifications and evidence actions | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `get_conflict_events` | Conflict map/presentation | Compare actual events, markers, dates and selection | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `get_natural_disasters` | Hazard map/presentation | Compare events, layers, dates and detail interactions | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `get_prediction_markets` | Prediction panels | Compare providers, contract links, probabilities and resolution | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `get_forecast_predictions` | Forecast presentation | Compare event definition, horizon, uncertainty and calibration | Compact card; behavioral parity unaccepted |
| `open_news_dashboard` | News panels and map | Complete 2D/3D, marker selection, layer/filter and country integration | Scoped real components; full acceptance incomplete |

Baseline owners must be located before promising feature-specific widget changes. A data-only utility can remain data-only. New UI tools should represent user workflows, not duplicate all 84 data tool names.

## Implemented unit checks

- `e2e/plugin-country-view.spec.ts` drives the actual compiled entry in an opaque sandbox. It checks the ordinary section mounts, host-only reads, source handoff, model context, desktop/mobile widths, retained facts after failure, delayed country switching, actual report HTML and scenario JSON downloads.
- `tests/country-brief-host-transport.test.mts` checks fixed routes, credential exclusion, country/section identity, cancellation, a three-call limit and generated-client zero-baseline serialization.
- `tests/mcp-country-view.test.mjs` checks reader validation, signed downstream access, access denial, billing/backoff handling, fixed-origin resource loading and CSP.
- Existing MCP regression suites cover caller contracts, policy, weights, quotas, resources and version inventory. Existing website country tests remain separate regression gates.

## Executed baseline checks

- Public resource audit read all 11 linked UI resources successfully. Counts are from the saved production tools discovery. Template availability is not native rendering proof.
- Existing Chromium test `US brief keeps late evidence, metric design and report data connected` passed on reviewed main. It uses fixtures and checks source measurements, scorecard inputs, report download contents, CSP and mobile output layout. It does not test plugin OAuth or live source freshness.
- Existing compact-widget suite `tests/mcp-country-brief-app.test.mts` passed two tests. It verifies assessment/date/evidence rendering. Passing it demonstrates why the old test boundary cannot establish full country parity.
- The shared catalog extraction preserves the original exports. All three existing presentation regressions passed after that change. This proves the extraction preserves those behaviors; it does not prove full plugin parity.
- Signed-in Chrome session inspection timed out during baseline review. No native country-view pass is recorded. The compiled fixture view was manually inspected in the in-app browser.

## Delivery gates

### Signed-in acceptance checkpoint, 2026-10-02

Production deployment of the panel-metering merge succeeded at 15:22 UTC. The signed-in Chrome conversation `Open USA brief` shows the country view tool and the native news-and-map iframe. The latest news call returned HTTP 429 with the 50/day allowance exhausted. That response supplies no headline or marker evidence. It resets at 2026-10-03 00:00 UTC. Native acceptance remains incomplete.

| Website output | Observed ChatGPT output | Difference and repair status |
|---|---|---|
| IMF economics and BIS housing use public on-demand bootstrap data | Exact IMF and housing section calls returned `locked` despite an authorized connection | The MCP readers used the legacy authenticated multi-key URL. Fixed single-key public URLs preserve the existing bundle shape. Real bootstrap-handler integration verifies seven dataset reads consume one country allocation. Native retest awaits deployment and quota reset. |
| Complete data can be reused; missing datasets can recover | A partial bootstrap bundle could remain cached by the panel receipt and browser transport | Partial bundles are excluded from both caches. Recovery checks verify retries and subsequent reuse without an extra allocation. |
| Dashboard shows country signals and military observations | The inspected country context reported signals and military unavailable | The military projection now shares the website owner and has controlled activity/outage checks. Signals remain open. Fresh native comparison remains open. |
| News panels and map display current source data | A new call hit quota exhaustion; an existing expanded app renders populated news and 2D/3D markers | Loaded-snapshot rendering and local search were observed. Fresh request, usage notice, error delivery and recovery remain open. |

Further inspection of the existing expanded `WorldMonitor MCP Acceptance` app showed populated news panels and markers in both the 3D globe and the 2D WebGL map. Local search found the Afghanistan article and applied its Asia-Pacific category. This proves rendering and navigation of the loaded snapshot. It does not prove a fresh paid request or the receipt/usage notice. The host composer covers part of the expanded map. Chrome also lists a separate installed `WorldMonitor` cloud plugin at version 2.10.1; acceptance must identify which connection supplies each tool call.

Bootstrap recovery now preserves successful siblings when another dataset times out, fails or returns an invalid payload. The shared country renderer labels missing measurements as partial coverage and clears the notice after recovery. This warning is included in the model's rendered context and report capture. These checks remain controlled local evidence until the repair is deployed and tested natively.

Local integration, renderer fixtures, merged source, production deployment and native acceptance are separate verdicts. This checkpoint does not establish store readiness.

Run focused existing behavior tests first. Browser changes also require `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint:boundaries`; MCP/API changes require `npm run typecheck:api` and focused handler/quota tests. Add only regressions needed for the matrix failures. Preserve the existing 84 tool schemas and subscription behavior.

For each UI PR, attach inspected desktop/mobile screenshots at the tested commit and failure/recovery views when applicable. A local preview, template read, green CI, merge and deployment are distinct evidence states. Native acceptance begins after the exact asset/tool version is deployed and the installed plugin definitions are refreshed.

## Local verdict, 2026-10-01

The full non-built-output unit suite passes 33,963 tests, with 19 skips and no failures. The compiled country-view suite passes all three tests. The existing website US evidence/report and limited-country/China tests pass. All 2,213 MCP tests pass, including the new transport checks. All 1,686 DOM tests pass, including country switching, entitlement revocation and existing-panel initialization. The website build passes the unchanged bundle budget and all 1,932 built-output tests. Lazy military-card refresh is now covered by a runtime barrier test. The original text-only country prompt retains its executable risk, assessment and macro steps; the interactive view has a separate prompt. Browser/API typechecks, architectural boundaries, product inventory and source-attribution checks pass. Biome reports no errors; its existing repository warnings are outside this change.

These checks do not establish live source freshness, ordinary ChatGPT prompt routing or full parity. The open rows above remain delivery gates for that broader objective.

## Country Signals partial repair, 2026-10-03

| Website behavior | Embedded behavior in this unit | Verification and remaining difference |
|---|---|---|
| Military Signals count observations near the country, with separate counts inside its borders | Reuses the military panel's licensed observations and the same shared near/inside projector | Controlled country scope and precise negative geometry checks; no new host reader or data call. Live source and redistribution differences still require matching native observations. |
| Loaded country Signals persist while CII updates | Score-only updates preserve loaded counts and agent context | A score refresh with no Signals cannot erase them; existing website severity totals and recent evidence survive count refreshes together. |
| Signals sources and aggregate country-cluster details are independent inputs | Four military fields are observed or null. Other 24 fields and aggregate severity/recent details are explicitly unavailable | Nullable coverage prevents fabricated zero counts or severity totals. Full 28-field and 24-hour/1,000-observation aggregator parity remains open. |
| Country navigation reuses loaded observations | Topic navigation reuses Signals and military observations | Compiled opaque-iframe regression covers observed, source-outage retention, recovery and authorization loss, one allocation per refresh, navigation reuse and desktop/mobile layout. This is controlled local evidence; deployment and native acceptance remain pending. |

The website's existing severity and three-recent-item projection is now a shared pure function. Country selection, timestamps, pruning, global cap and targeted theater replacement remain with the existing aggregator. The embedded military subset does not claim to reconstruct that aggregator. No tool schema, allowance, host registry or provider changes are included.

## October 3 market chart checkpoint

[PR #8813](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor/pull/8813) restores chart inspection from the same loaded market series. This is controlled local proof and PR delivery; it does not establish deployed ChatGPT acceptance.

| Website behavior | Plugin baseline | Repair proof | Remaining acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| MarketPanel shows asset names and loaded quotes | Each class capped again at eight rows; names omitted | Every loaded or sampled quote, including summary/JMESPath projections; name-only sectors retained | Compare matching live source observations after deployment |
| Original intraday chart opens from loaded series | Series discarded | Shared miniSparkline and terminalChart; full chart created on first keyboard expansion and reused on reopen | Confirm live series availability and native host interaction |
| Missing measurements remain unknown | No chart coverage explanation | Missing series, null prices/changes and supplied source limits/dates remain explicit | Curated seed cannot explain arbitrary-symbol absence |
| Loaded inspection does not fetch again | Compact result only | Desktop/mobile opaque iframe sends no extra tool calls; remaining usage stays 47 | Verify native allocation, refresh accounting and notices |
| Account watchlist and requested-symbol lookup | No matching account write or arbitrary query | Outside this chart unit; no fake persistence or provider failure inference | Separate authenticated source and metering work |

Verification includes 198 focused market/chart/resource, anonymous conformance, usage and CI-inventory checks in Pacific/Auckland, browser/API types, plugin build, boundaries, safe HTML, docs/discovery and the actual pre-push gates. Two permanent desktop/mobile CI browser tests load the real Vite document, CSS and module through the resource bootstrap. Controlled screenshots show fourteen loaded rows versus ten before, with the chart available from eleven supplied series. Fourteen inspected UI images are attached to the PR, including six refreshed after review repairs. Remote CI, merge, deployment, source freshness and native acceptance remain separate verdicts.

Review repairs preserve same-country loaded military Signal counts on an unavailable refresh and label them as previously loaded, not fresh. Authorization loss clears the affected counts, and a successful observed zero replaces a prior positive count. A new country does not inherit old counts. An empty flight RPC remains unknown because the producer returns the same empty shape for source failures and the host registry explicitly rejects unconfirmed initial empties. AIS supplies a separate connected-snapshot coverage contract. Unknown temporal observations also leave initial aggregate severity unknown.

The initial DOM-test typecheck failed because a fixture used `Strike` instead of the typed `MILITARY` value. The repaired fixture and refresh regressions run through the actual DOM-test typecheck before delivery; the initial CI failure is not a passing validation result.

## Native setup burst repair, October 3

An ordinary USA panel opened through WorldMonitor MCP Acceptance after the paid-panel burst deployment. It reported 16 ready and seven unavailable sections. Resilience reported a 60-per-minute user limit. The daily notice decreased once, from 48 to 47 of 50. Those observations do not attribute every unavailable section to the limiter.

The matching account window recorded 39 initialization attempts, including 20 refusals, and 19 successful initialized acknowledgments. Another 39 methods were recorded as unregistered, so their actual names remain unknown. Recognized data-free methods shared the ordinary data bucket before the repair.

| Website or panel expectation | Native observation | Repair and remaining proof |
|---|---|---|
| Internal section loads complete under one admission | Connection initialization exhausted the user burst before some section calls | A separate fixed user protocol bucket allows 192 requests per minute, enough for 64 read connections with three setup calls each. A real-handler regression failed on connection 20 before the repair. |
| Data budgets and authorization still apply | Paid panel reads already had their own 64-request burst | Ordinary plan data limits, panel receipt checks, daily accounting and grant revocation remain enforced. Operator-key and anonymous discovery limits remain 60. Unsupported methods do not enter the protocol bucket. |
| Deployed ChatGPT behavior matches local proof | Several sections still unavailable | The local regression is controlled evidence. Exact deployment and fresh native acceptance remain required. Full source parity and the separate cloud-plugin installation are open. |

Local verification passed 2,098 MCP JavaScript checks and 223 typed MCP checks, API typecheck, API contract, scoped Biome, Markdown and generated public discovery checks. These runs use the real handler with controlled dependencies and an enabled minute limiter. They do not establish production source freshness or installed-host acceptance.

## Deployed native checkpoint, October 4

The exact handshake merge deployed to Vercel Production at 00:43:15 UTC. Native Chrome country and news panels identify WorldMonitor MCP Acceptance. The separate cloud plugin installation remains unaccepted. The country validation chat completed its native report and a later anonymous website comparison; the panels chat delivered 66 controlled passing checks but could not initialize native computer use. The owner retained both evidence sets and resumed the news interactions in signed-in Chrome. These are partial acceptance results.

| Expected website concept | Native result | Remaining difference |
|---|---|---|
| Country brief opens with sections | USA interactive panel, 18 ready and five unavailable; two result cards for one prompt | Resilience hit 64 requests/minute/panel. A retry recovered score 58 and coverage 87%. Complete-section acceptance fails. |
| Original Atlas details and evidence | Country-specific pipeline and storage totals displayed; Acadian pipeline and Bryan Mound SPR original detail/evidence/timeline UI opened | The later anonymous website snapshot did not load pipeline/storage count rows or the observed SPR detail drawer. Matching populated caches, tier and source dates remain unaccepted; the native detail concept works. |
| Economic measurements retain units | IMF growth 2.3%, CPI 3.2%, unemployment 4.4%, primary balance -3.7% GDP, per-capita GDP 94.4k; BIS residential 154.2, commercial 187.3 and debt service 8.0 | The three public IMF values match the later website snapshot. All displayed BIS values, units, changes and reporting periods also match: housing 2026 Q2 and debt service 2026 Q1. IMF vintage and additional premium values remain unaccepted; BIS dataset vintage was not independently fetched. |
| Energy observations | Public energy values and periods match the later website snapshot across OWID, World Bank, JODI, Ember and IMF PortWatch | This is the observed public subset; it does not establish same-tier full-section parity. |
| Military sources and Signals coverage | Flights, AIS and fleet unavailable or unconfirmed; derived counts unknown | The later anonymous website has populated military observations, but rights and source times differ. Unknown is not zero. Other 24 Signals fields and aggregate severity/recent items remain open. |
| Native news dashboard with coverage | Ordinary prompt opened interactive news and maps. Summary exposed served story, publisher, feed and category completion counts for the 07:39 UTC snapshot | Later snapshot than the website observation; no claim of identical feed completion or freshness. |
| Desktop 2D and 3D maps | Colored headline markers in 2D; headline rings on the 3D globe | Native 2D uses the green-grid fallback while the observed website uses WEBGL. Approximate capital locations are not verified event coordinates. |
| Marker selection and source details | Reuters North Korea headline opens a News popup labeled approximate Pyongyang | Popup shows headline only; source link and further details are absent in this observation. |
| Map inspection beside conversation | Workspace expansion puts globe beside composer | Inline composer consumes the lower visible map area. Native mobile layout remains unaccepted. |
| One allocation per meaningful opening | USA cards show 49 remaining; news shows 48. Retry and navigation retain the opening notice | Notices are not a direct post-navigation accounting audit. Explicit refresh and paid cost/allowance suitability remain pending. |
| Compact forecast, prediction and market details | Controlled checks pass for case evidence, contract fields and shared charts | Native compact-panel acceptance remains pending. Forecast theaters, account watchlist and arbitrary-symbol lookup remain separate proven gaps. |

The bounded account/time telemetry window records 64 successful and 64 denied country-section calls with successful protocol initialization. It does not identify each card/transport or cache hit. A real-handler regression independently proves that settled cached replay can exhaust the minute bucket needed by a remaining uncached section.

The repair separates server-confirmed cached replay and uncached reads after paid admission validation. Each retains a 64-per-minute bound. Durable actual uncached work remains capped at 64 per admission; one opening still charges one daily allocation. Client input cannot select the bucket. Owner, scope, expiry, account revocation and ordinary operator/API limits remain enforced. Simultaneous cold duplicates are not claimed coalesced. Local proof and a ready PR do not establish deployed native recovery.

A later native World News filter changed the expanded map and panel locally. The loaded-only follow-up answered `Politics` while the UI showed `World News`. Configuration maps the selected internal key `politics` to that visible label, so this is a label mismatch, not evidence that category selection or context ownership failed. The receipt currently includes the ID without its display label. The follow-up also reported no marker identity, but the popup had been closed, so active-selection persistence is not established. The shared website news popup also renders only a headline; absent rich marker details are not a demonstrated website regression. These label and selected-item context limits are separate from the replay-budget repair.

## October 4 native validation and injected-document recovery

After the approved replay and desktop-renderer repairs deployed at production commit `87e675115ff8bad45650016acb37642e696ceaee`, the actual signed-in Chrome Acceptance connection was refreshed. A fresh ordinary USA/all request rendered one interactive card with 21 ready sections and two unavailable. Resilience loaded on its first attempt (58, coverage87%, seed August17). Five-Factor Scorecard and National Debt remain unavailable. A fresh news request rendered the desktop WebGL map with current headline dots, a 3D globe with rings, and a WebGL return; expanded workspace keeps the composer adjacent. Inline composer obstruction, exact viewport settlement, all source/tier/date comparisons and independent accounting remain unaccepted. Visible opening notices decreased46→45→44 for market, country and news; this is not a server-ledger proof of every internal read or refresh.

| Surface | Native result | Remaining difference |
|---|---|---|
| USA/all | 21 ready, two unavailable; Resilience58/87% loads first attempt | Scorecard and National Debt unavailable; full same-tier/source comparisons incomplete |
| Desktop news map | WebGL markers in inline and narrow workspace; globe rings;2D return | Inline composer overlap, coordinate settlement, selection context and mobile remain open |
| Market Radar | Refreshed connection renders94quotes and48-point BTC full chart | Ordinary initial response misreported available UI; cached failed card Retry became blank; matching observations/mobile/watchlist/lookup incomplete |
| Prediction Markets | One ordinary prompt opens linked contracts, volume, closes, conviction and Yes/No bars; local geopolitical expansion reaches25of25 | Same-observation website/mobile/all-category comparison and independent ledger remain unaccepted; opening notice43 remains during expansion |
| Forecasts | One ordinary prompt produces two output-budget error cards, then an empty filtered panel | Notices decrease43→42→41→40 across automatic attempts; model claims14loaded cases but UI reports unavailable. Native transport/projection and meaningful-request accounting fail |
| Signals | Loaded military counts available |24otherfields plus aggregate severity/recent evidence remain unknown |

The cached-card failure is reproduced with a shell injected into an opaque `about:blank` iframe: `location.reload()` replaces the host-injected document with an empty page. The bootstrap now retries in place. Each import uses a loader-owned numeric attempt directory, and each entrypoint listens for that import's one-shot mount event. A constrained static rewrite serves the original JavaScript files at those paths. Relative shared imports inherit the attempt directory, so retry does not wait on an abandoned graph. Both fragment-only and entry-query controls failed shared-load recovery. Manifest queries and foreign assets are still rejected, and existing document/style/module10-second bounds remain. Late imports do not receive later attempts' mount events or start host/data reads. Original cached shells retain the legacy mount event; remove that compatibility only after those cached resource versions are retired. Direct documents retain normal startup.

Permanent browser proof includes real compiled Market Radar recovery in injected desktop/mobile documents, existing compiled country/news startup, same-filename document/style/module retries, failed and stalled shared chunks, and a stalled import completed after the recovered attempt. This is controlled proof, not deployed native acceptance of this recovery repair. Metadata refresh restored a new market card; it did not recover the older instance. Overall plugin acceptance remains incomplete.

The repaired bootstrap is advertised under country-view-v3.html, news-dashboard-v3.html and market-radar-v3.html so hosts can fetch new shell code rather than reuse cached v2 reload handlers. V2 and older read aliases still return the current shell; remove these aliases only when saved installed connections and resource links are retired. Existing cached result documents cannot be patched retroactively. Refresh installed tool metadata after deployment, then validate a new native result.

## Forecast transport and current acceptance, October 4

The human merged the injected-document repair as `da33e7a0196006a5608ca268dd45f154b1dbbce7`. Exact Vercel Production `dpl_DnpSSvZ3c1znj9wGnNp8GdrDYkfk` reached READY at 13:09:28 UTC, and the production alias was independently confirmed. The actual signed-in Chrome Acceptance connection refreshed its metadata afterward. One fresh market request rendered 94 quotes and the original 48-point BTC chart. Its opening notice changed from 40 to 39 remaining. This proves fresh native startup and local chart inspection for that connection; it does not prove forced native Retry recovery or independent quota accounting. The right chart label clips, and the inline composer still covers the lower view.

| Website or user expectation | Verified result | Remaining acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Forecast list fits transport and exposes original cases | Controlled canonical dossiers exceed 128 KB; paid opening projects the original compact list, preserving IDs, generation and unknown odds | New repair must be merged, deployed and tested in the installed host |
| One allocation includes original detail reads | Signed forecast admission limits reads to a closed list/case scope; exact-generation case returns an unchanged original row | Native automatic retries and actual ledger need a fresh deployed test |
| Filters and reopening reuse original evidence | Exported HTML in desktop/mobile opaque iframes loads original analysis, supporting/counter evidence and branches, then reuses it | Native original evidence, host capability and same source observation remain unaccepted |
| Failed detail can recover | Manual Retry repeats a failed read; unavailable source results are not cached as successful cases | Deployed source recovery remains unaccepted |
| Host uses the renderer that supports compact results | Advertised forecast resource is versioned; old URI remains a read alias | Refresh installed metadata after deployment |
| World News follow-up uses displayed label | Separate PR #8826 adds World News label alongside stable politics ID; compiled receipt tests and CI pass | PR remains unmerged; native follow-up remains unaccepted |

The controlled actual dispatcher fixture measures a 254,903-byte canonical feed and a 5,782-byte serialized opening result including receipts and usage. These are synthetic transport measurements, not production costs. A single case that exceeds the unchanged output budget reports an explicit error; no allowance refund or budget increase is used. API-key full-result contracts remain unchanged. Local proof, remote CI, merge, deployment and native acceptance remain separate. Overall acceptance remains incomplete.

## Original forecast theaters: controlled transport and interface proof

This unit depends on the signed forecast admission in PR #8827. The website reads latest simulation theaters separately from the prediction list. The plugin now exposes a closed `get_forecast_theaters` reader and a **Load active theaters** action. Both use the original forecast admission, one daily opening allocation and the existing 64 uncached-read budget. Source run/time remains independent of the forecast generation.

| Website expectation | Controlled proof | Remaining acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Original active theater evidence | All published paths, actors, optional roles, reactions, stabilizers and invalidators are transported unchanged and expand locally | Merge, exact production deployment, installed metadata refresh and matching native observation |
| Genuine partial, missing and failed coverage | Distinct source states; partial evidence survives failed retry, then manual recovery succeeds | Native source recovery and same-tier source comparison |
| One allocation includes internal evidence | Actual dispatcher fixture verifies opening plus latest theater read and successful replay under one daily allocation and the shared 64-read bound | Independent native ledger and explicit refresh accounting |
| Current renderer discovers the reader | Forecasts v3 resource; v2 and original URI remain private read aliases | Native host capability and metadata refresh after deployment |

Focused transport, original handler, metering, resource and exported-HTML checks pass locally. Eight inspected desktop/mobile fixtures show before, partial evidence, failed retry and completed recovery. Local proof is not CI readiness, deployment or native acceptance. Overall acceptance remains incomplete.

### Bounded observed Signals checkpoint

One closed country-section execution composes earthquake, Internet outage, sampled travel advisory count, native advisory level and thermal escalation values from four fixed authorized source reads. Counts describe returned samples; unknown clocks, partial coverage and retained observations stay explicit in the UI, model context and evidence export. Independent military results preserve their own four fields and static classification. The other 18 typed Signals and aggregate severity/recent evidence remain unknown. Current-main local proof, remote CI, deployment and native acceptance must be recorded separately; these source changes alone establish none of the latter claims.
