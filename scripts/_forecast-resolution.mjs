// Pure spec-builder module for the forecast resolvability contract (#4976 Bet 1).
//
// Every published forecast gets a machine-checkable ResolutionSpec: `hard`
// (auto-resolvable from a WorldMonitor feed the detector already scored from)
// or `judged` (a resolution question for a later LLM judge, Bet 2). This
// module owns that dispatch, the feed allowlist a hard spec's `sourceFeed`
// must belong to (R4), and the deadline math (R5).
//
// No console output in normal operation. No Date.now() anywhere — every
// timestamp is threaded in as `generatedAt` so output is deterministic and
// testable (same inputs -> identical spec across calls).
//
// metricKey format: '<feedKey>|<fn>(<field>==<value>)' — a path expression
// over the shape read from that feed, with REAL substituted values (region,
// title, ticker) and a unified '==' comparison grammar across every family,
// e.g. 'conflict:acled-resolution:v1:all:0:0|count(country==Mali)' or
// 'market:commodities-bootstrap:v1|price(symbol==CL=F)'. It documents where in
// the feed the metric lives and what to match; it is not executable code and
// is not parsed by this module or any consumer today (Bet 2's resolver
// interprets it). The grammar is frozen into 45-day history, so it must be
// consistent — no literal '<region>'/'<title>' placeholders, no '=' vs '=='
// drift between families. count() means NEW events dated within the spec's
// 'within-horizon' window ([emission, deadline]), with a horizon-scoped
// threshold (#5010) — never the feed's full 365-day trailing tally.
